# Next.js Charity-Donor Engagement Platform

This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/packages/create-next-app), designed to enhance interactions between charities and donors through real-time communication and dynamic insights.

## Getting Started
