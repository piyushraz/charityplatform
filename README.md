# Next.js Charity-Donor Engagement Platform

This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/packages/create-next-app), designed to enhance interactions between charities and donors through real-time communication and dynamic insights.

## Getting Started

To get a local copy up and running follow these simple steps.

### Prerequisites

This project runs with Node.js and npm. Ensure you have them installed before proceeding.

### Installation

1. Clone the repo:
   ```bash
   git clone https://yourgithubrepo.git
   ```
2. Install NPM packages:
   ```bash
   npm install
   # or
   yarn install
   ```

### Running the Development Server

Start the development server by running:
```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result. You can start editing the page by modifying `pages/index.tsx`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

### API Routes

Access API routes by navigating to [http://localhost:3000/api/hello](http://localhost:3000/api/hello). Edit this endpoint by modifying `pages/api/hello.ts`. The `pages/api` directory is mapped to `/api/*` and files in this directory are treated as API routes.
